The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into Xcode and the Swift compiler. **This is the recommended installation method.** Updates to SwiftyStoreKit will always be available immediately to projects with SPM. SPM is also integrated directly with Xcode.

If you are using Xcode 11 or later:
 1. Click `File`
 2. `Swift Packages`
 3. `Add Package Dependency...`
 4. Specify the git URL for SwiftyStoreKit.
